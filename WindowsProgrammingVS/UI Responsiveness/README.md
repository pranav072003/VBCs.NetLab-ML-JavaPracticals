# experimented with user interactive tools in C#.Net Environment (Anchor and Dock properties of Controls).
# tried adding and removing controls from a panel container, and changing its dock properties at runtime based on selecting checkbox.
# parsed user input in form of a double variable to calculate area and circumference of a circle.
# added a progress bar whose position changes with ticking of timer event, and menustrip consisting of different options (along with their associated shortcut keys).
